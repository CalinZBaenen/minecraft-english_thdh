# English (Thorn & Eth)


## What is ~~ðis~~ this resourcepack?
This resourcepack adds support for a variation of English using thorn and eth
to Minecraft.  
`English (Thorn & Eth)` uses `English (United States)` (`en_us`) as a base, and replaces `Shakespearean English` (`enws`).


## What are ~~þorn~~ thorn and ~~eð~~ eth?
Thorn (uppercase `Þ`, lowercase `þ`) and eth (uppercase `Ð`, lowercase `ð`) are old
Latin letters from older protogermanic languages such as Old Norse; they had
even made their way into Old English. Eventually, however, they were dropped
due to misreadings, lack of support on the printingpress, and other factors that required
the language to evolve.  
Currently, thorn and eth are still in two well known, very much alive, languages:
Icelandic and Faroese.
